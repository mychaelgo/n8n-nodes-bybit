## Licensing FAQ

### Is internal SaaS infrastructure considered internal use?
No. If the infrastructure supports a revenue-generating service,
it is considered commercial use.

### What if customers never see the node?
Visibility is irrelevant. Revenue enablement constitutes commercial use.

### What if we are a startup?
Startups are commercial entities and require a commercial license.

### What if we only use one workflow?
Scope does not change license requirements.

### Do proof-of-concepts require a license?
Internal, non-customer-facing POCs are permitted.
Production SaaS deployments require a license.
